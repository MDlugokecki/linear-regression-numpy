# linear-regression-numpy
In this notebook I have implemented two solutions for solving linear regression problem. One is gradiend descent and the second is normal equation.
I have also writen and included in this notebook a class for solving linear regression problems. It automatically choses between gradient descent
and normal equation depending on number of samples in data given to fit the model.
All have been done using NumPy.
